Moreover, on our road towards mainnet availability we\'ll need to strengthen our testing process in order to validate Mithril network on more realistic environments.\\n\\n### Release Process\\n\\nWe want our release process to follow some basic principles:\\n\\n- _Continuous Integration_: New code is integrated into the `main` codeline frequently which triggers automated build and test process.\\n- _Continuous Deployment_: New artifacts produced by the build process are continuously deployed to a suitable _environment_ where it can be used and tested by an increasing number of parties.\\n- _Deployment Pipeline_: The deployment process is embodied in a _pipeline_ that describes and implements all the necessary steps to release a new version of Mithril.\\n- _Artifact Promotion_: An artifact is built _once and only once_ and is _promoted_ while travelling through the build pipeline.\\n\\nHere is a high-level picture of this process:\\n\\n[![Release Process](./img/release_process.jpg)](./img/release_process.jpg)\\n\\n- We will use a custom version based on [SemVer](https://semver.org) for all the crates, binaries and containers of the repository and for the GitHub release.\\n- We release a new distribution every 2 weeks (this duration is subject to changes as the project matures)\\n  - The released version is named after the year and its week number: **YYWW.patch** (e.g. `2250.0`).\\n  - In case of critical regressions happening in production, a patch version will be released in between \\"official\\" releases as a hotfix.\\n- A new version `YYWW.0` will have the following life cycle:\\n  - A commit `abc123` merged on `main` branch is deployed on the network named `testing-preview`.\\n  - A commit `def456` tagged with `YYWW.0-prerelease` is deployed on the network named `pre-release-preview`.\\n  - A GitHub release `YYWW.0-prerelease` is created and linked with the `YYWW.0-prerelease` tag and marked as `pre-release`.\\n  - A tag `YYWW.0-prerelease` is qualified and selected for release or rejected (and replaced by a `YYWW.1-prerelease` tag if necessary on a `fed789`).\\n  - If the tag `YYWW.0-prerelease` is selected, a new tag is created and name `YYWW.0` on the same commit `def456`.\\n  - A GitHub release `YYWW.0` is created and linked to the `YYWW.0` tag and marked as `release`.\\n  - The commit `def456` with tag `YYWW.0` is deployed to the network named `release-preprod`.\\n- The `Cargo.toml` versions of the crates are updated (if required) just before creating the `YYWW.0-prerelease` tag .\\n- The documentation website is also updated at the same time where the `next` version becomes the `current` version, leaving future updates be appended to the `next` version during the upcoming developments.\\n- In order to simplify the life of Mithril users, we have introduced a version of the `Mithril API` used between client/signer and aggregators to check if the nodes are able to communicate together (following semver and considering the versions are compatible only if they share the same minor).\\n- Our main distribution artifact is currently docker (OCI) images. We also provide more packages, eg. `.deb` packages or compiled binaries (some of them available on multiple platforms, e.g. Windows or macOS) to simplify users\' life.\\n- We also publish some of our crates on the `crates.io` registry whenever a new version is created (e.g. [`mithril-stm`](https://crates.io/crates/mithril-stm)).\\n\\n### Networks\\n\\n- We maintain different Mithril networks (eg. servers, VMs, configurations...) to which artifacts are deployed at various stages of the process:\\n  - `testing-preview`: This is an internal environment based on the `preview` cardano testnet where most of the automated tests happen. It is also used to test features as soon as they are merged on the `main` branch.\\n  - `pre-release-preview`: This is a persistent environment based on the `preview` cardano testnet. SPOs which are active on preview are welcomed to take part in the Mithril signing process and to test new `pre-release` distributions deployed there.\\n  - `release-preprod`: Another persistent environment, based on the `preprod` cardano testnet, where more SPOs are expected to join and test, updated less frequently (on actual `release` distributions).\\n  - (_LATER_) `mainnet`: Production environment where new releases are deployed once qualifed on `release-preprod`.\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\n- The Mithril developers have redacted an ADR [Release process and versioning](https://mithril.network/doc/adr/3/) that also describes more technically this process."},{"id":"/2022/10/28/updated-environments","metadata":{"permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/10/28/updated-environments","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-28-updated-environments.md","title":"Mithril environments are updated","description":"The Mithril environments are updated","date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release-process","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/release-process"},{"inline":true,"label":"re-spin","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/re-spin"},{"inline":true,"label":"preview","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/preview"},{"inline":true,"label":"preprod","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/preprod"},{"inline":true,"label":"environments","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/environments"}],"readingTime":1.3,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mithril Team"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Mithril environments are updated","authors":[{"name":"Mithril Team"}],"tags":["release-process","re-spin","preview","preprod","environments"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Mithril Release Process","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/12/05/release-process"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mithril Keys Certification","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/10/11/keys-certification-badge"}},"content":"### The Mithril environments are updated\\n\\n**PR**: `New hosted environments` [#561](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/561)\\n\\n**Issue**: `Setup new hosted environments for testing-preview, pre-release-preview and release-preprod) with their terraform and GitHub environments` [#542](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/542)\\n\\nOn Tuesday, November 1st, 2022 the `preview` Cardano network will be re-spun and will be unavailable for 48h.\\n\\nIn the mean time, the Mitril team is also implementing a new Release Process that will make use of several new environments.\\n\\nThe Mithril testing environments are thus evolving in this context:\\n\\n- The current testing environment that runs on `preview` network and that most of the Pioneer SPOs are running is **deprecated** and will be decommissioned just after the `preview` network re-spin.\\n\\n- This environment will then be replaced by a new `pre-release-preview` environment open to SPOs that are eager to test pre releases of the Mithril nodes.\\n\\n- A new `release-preprod` environment has been launched on the `preprod` Cardano nework and will become the `stable` environment on which SPOs are encouraged to run their nodes.\\n\\n- :warning: The new `release-preprod` environment is in `unstable` status, therefore it is subject to re-genesis.

This internal store mechanism used to be a bunch of JSON files saved in a given directory. Even though this does the job it still presents flaws: data are hard to query when debugging especially when crossing data (which signers have participated in this multi-signature?). Also, data are stored in different places which can be a problem when moving these files from one place to another. We also had to imagine what would be a migration scenario in case of a structure change. Switching to a file based SQL database solves these issues.\\n\\nThe new release now uses SQLite stores in place of JSON file storage. This means that to continue running a Signer or an Aggregator node it is necessary to migrate from the old storage system to SQLite. This release comes with a tool to perform the migration which should be as straightforward as launching a command line (read below). The migration tool will be available only for a limited time in order to make Mithril beta testers able to migrate their existing data.\\n\\n## How to migrate data from old storage system to SQLite stores?\\n\\nThere are 2 ways of getting the new version and the associated migration tool. Either downloading binaries from GitHub or compiling them yourself.\\n\\n### Downloading\\n\\nDownload the new `mithril-signer` and `mithril-signer-migrate` files from the [nightly builds page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/unstable). Make them executable:\\n\\n```\\n$> chmod +x mithril-signer*\\n$> ls -1F mithril-signer*\\nmithril-signer*\\nmithril-signer-migrate*\\n```\\n\\n_note_: the suffix `*` appended to the the entries output above indicates the file is executable. If it is not present, ensure the `chmod` command does not produce any error.\\n\\n### Compiling\\n\\nIf you used to compile your node as stated in the [guide](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/run-signer-node), you have to compile the migration tool as well:\\n\\n```\\n$> cd mithril-signer\\n$> cargo build --all-targets --release\\n  Compiling mithril-signer v0.1.0 (/home/somebody/shared/mithril/mithril-signer)\\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 4.56s\\n$> ls -1F ../target/release/mithril-signer*\\n../target/release/mithril-signer*\\n../target/release/mithril-signer.d\\n../target/release/mithril-signer-migrate*\\n../target/release/mithril-signer-migrate.d\\n```\\n\\n### Running the migration\\n\\nThe first step is to stop the running Mithril node if any. The `mithril-signer-migrate` executable can perform the migration automatically once you know where your actual JSON files are located. Have a look in your configuration file (default `/opt/mithril/mithril-signer.env`), check the value associated with the `DATA_STORES_DIRECTORY` key (default to `/opt/mithril/stores`) and copy the path indicated here. Copy this path after the `--db-dir` option on the following command line:\\n\\n```\\n$> ./mithril-signer-migrate automatic --db-dir /paste/the/data/stores/directory/here\\nMithril Aggregator JSON \u2192 SQLite migration tool.\\nMigrating protocol_initializer_store data\u2026\\nOK \u2713\\nMigrating stake_store data\u2026\\nOK \u2713\\n```\\n\\nAt the end of this command, a file `signer.sqlite3` (or `aggregator.sqlite3` if you run an Aggregator) should be present in the specified base directory.\\n\\nThat should be enough, launch your upgraded mithril node.\\n\\n**Note:** The migration executable does not remove the old JSON files from the disk.\\n\\n### Manual migration process\\n\\nThe executable also provides a `manual` switch for migrating Mithril JSON store directories placed in custom directories. This is mainly intended for developers who work on tweaked environments. Each internal store has its own data structure. In order to correctly migrate and process data, the type of the store has to be given on the command line.\\n\\n```\\n$> ./mithril-signer-migrate manual --help\\n```\\n\\nThe command above should give you all informations needed to run a custom store migration.\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5kaErDKDRq) for questions and/or help."},{"id":"/2022/09/13/stake-distribution-retrieval","metadata":{"permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/09/13/stake-distribution-retrieval","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-13-stake-distribution-retrieval.md","title":"Stake Distribution retrieval fixed","description":"Update the computation now relies on the new cardano-cli query stake-snapshot --all-stake-pools command that retrieves the Stake Distribution all at once and that is way faster.

This has lead to some de-synchronization between the Signers and the hosted GCP Aggregator for a few epochs.\\n\\nIndeed, the `Stake Distribution` retrieved from the Cardano node depended on the time at which it was done: the nodes where having differents values that prevented them from being able to work together to produce valid multi-signatures. The problem is related to the epoch that is used (**current epoch**) to make the computation of the `Stake Distribution` when the `cardano-cli query stake-distribution` command is ran, whereas the Mithril protocol needs to work with the **previous epoch**.\\n\\nA workaround is being implemented in this fix that will compute differently the `Stake Distribution` to target the **previous epoch**. To do so, the Stake value that is now retrieved sequentially for each pool available in the `cardano-cli query stake-distribution` by using the command `cardano-cli query stake-snapshot --stake-pool-id **pool-id*`. This guarantees that the `Stake Distribution` is computed deterministically on all nodes of the Mithril Network.\\n\\nWe will continue our efforts to enhance the way the `Stake Distribution` is retrieved in the future, and so that it works smoothly on the `mainnet` (where the numbers of pools is bigger `~3,000` vs `~100` on the `preview` network).\\n\\nThe SPOs need to recompile their Signer node in order to compute correctly the `Stake Distributions` on their node (as in this [guide](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/run-signer-node)).\\nIt should then take up to `2` epochs before they are able to successfully register their individual signatures with the Aggregator.\\n\\nMore information about the `Certificate Chain` and the epochs retrieval requirements is available [here](https://mithril.network/doc/mithril/mithril-protocol/certificates).\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5kaErDKDRq) for questions and/or help."},{"id":"/2022/09/12/certificate-signers-list","metadata":{"permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/09/12/certificate-signers-list","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-12-certificate-signers-list.md","title":"Signers list computation in Certificates","description":"The way the Signers list is computed inside a Certificate on the Mithril Aggregator is changing","date":"2022-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"certificate","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/certificate"}],"readingTime":0.825,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mithril Team"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Signers list computation in Certificates","authors":[{"name":"Mithril Team"}],"tags":["certificate"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Stake Distribution retrieval fixed","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/09/13/stake-distribution-retrieval"},"nextItem":{"title":"Genesis Certificate support added","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/09/07/genesis-certificate-feature"}},"content":"### The way the Signers list is computed inside a Certificate on the Mithril Aggregator is changing\\n\\n**PR**: `Implement filtered Signers in Certificate` [#494](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/494)\\n\\n**Issue**: `Record \'contributing\' Signers only in Certificate` [#495](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/495)\\n\\nBefore this change, the list of Signers displayed in the `Certificate` detail of the [Mithril Explorer](https://mithril.network/explorer/) was the list of **all eligible** Signers of the epoch used for signing (those who have successfully registered with the Mithril Aggregator `2` epochs earlier).\\n\\nNow that this change has been merged, the list of Signers displayed will only include the **contributing** Signers, which means only those who have successfully sent individual signatures.\\n\\nNote that the already existing `Certificates` will not be updated as this would break the `Certificate Chain` and therefore would involve the bootstraping of a new `Genesis Certificate`.\\n\\nThis change is transparent to the Signer nodes runned by the SPOs and does not require any specific action from them.\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5kaErDKDRq) for questions and/or help."},{"id":"/2022/09/07/genesis-certificate-feature","metadata":{"permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/09/07/genesis-certificate-feature","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-07-genesis-certificate-feature.md","title":"Genesis Certificate support added","description":"Update: The PR has been merged and the feature is being deployed on the GCP Mithril Aggregator.","date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"genesis","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/genesis"},{"inline":true,"label":"certificate","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/certificate"},{"inline":true,"label":"breaking-change","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/tags/breaking-change"}],"readingTime":1.12,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mithril Team"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Genesis Certificate support added","authors":[{"name":"Mithril Team"}],"tags":["genesis","certificate","breaking-change"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Signers list computation in Certificates","permalink":"/doc/dev-blog/2022/09/12/certificate-signers-list"}},"content":"**Update**: The PR has been merged and the feature is being deployed on the GCP Mithril Aggregator.\\n\\n### This afternoon, we plan to merge the PR that activates the Genesis Certificate feature on the GCP Mithril Aggregator\\n\\n**PR**: `Implement Real Genesis Certificate` [#438](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/438)\\n\\n**Issue**: `Bootstrap Certificate Chain w/ Genesis Certificate` [#364](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/issues/364)\\n\\nThis will involve some manual operations that will prevent temporarily the service to be running:\\n\\n- We will have to reset the stores of the `Snapshots` and `Certificates`.
